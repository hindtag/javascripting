Data types
    undefined -> something that hasn't been defined.
    null -> nothing
    boolean -> true or false
    symbol -> unique/unimmutable
    string -> any sort of texts
    number -> numbers
    object -> store different value pairs

Variable
    * Containers to store Data
    * label
    * like a box

    Example:
        myName
        myAge

    Declaring a Variable

        var a;

        var myName = "Mark";
            -> used throught your whole program

        let myName = "Biron";
            -> used within the scope of where you declared that.

        let myAge = 33;

        const myName = "Mark";
            -> should/can never change.

    
    Assigning a Variable -> using = after the Variable

    Initializing a Variable -> = "mark" for Example       


Initalize these three variable
    var a;
    var b;
    var c;

Initializing
    var a = 5;
    var b = 10;
    var c = "I am a string";

    and

    a = a + 1; //this is equals to 6
    b = b + 5; //this is equals to 15
    
Using proper naming convention
    properCamelCase
    myName

Using arithmetic operators
        +
        -
        *
        /
        % -> remainder

Augmented arithmetic operators
        +=
        -=
        *=
        /=

Incrementing numbers
    myVar++
    myAge++

Decrementing numbers
    myVar--
    myAge--

Declaring String Variable
    var firstName = "Mark";
    var lastName = "Biron";
    var myFirstName = "Tag";

    Escaping a qoutes
        Example:
            var myStr = "I am a \"double qouted\" string inside a \"double qoutes\"";
        console.log(myStr);
            var singleQoute = 'I am a "double qouted" string inside a "double qoutes"';
            console.log(singleQoute);
            var backticks = `I am a "double qouted" string inside a "double qoutes"`;
            console.log(backticks);
